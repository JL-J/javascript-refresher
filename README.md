## JavaScript Refresher

### Introduction

After completing the [JavaScript practice problems I found online](http://github.com/andrewhercules/javascript-practice), I've decided to recreate [Makers Academy's Ruby Refresher challenge](http://github.com/makersacademy/ruby-refresher) using JavaScript and Jasmine to further consolidate my (re)learning of JavaScript's structure and syntax.

### Languages/Platforms/Tools

* JavaScript
* Jasmine

### Learning Outcomes

Quite simply, I want to practice working in JavaScript before starting my InspiredBy project using the MEAN stack.

### To-do list

- [ ] Covert Ruby Refresher Rspec tests into Jasmine tests
- [ ] Add additional questions (if needed)
- [ ] Solve each problem using JavaScript best-practices

### Instructions

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:andrewhercules/javascript-refresher.git
```

### Notes

* symbolToString test removed due to limited support for JavaScript's Symbol() and Symbol.for() functions
